All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.0.1-alpha.1] - 2026-07-29

Initial alpha. First tagged snapshot after consolidating the stack into a single container.

### Added
- MQTT gateway with bidirectional Loxone &harr; MQTT mapping (HTTP and UDP transports).
- Monitor: value history over time with charts, tables, and CSV export.
- Custom dashboards (chart/table/current value/gauge/stat-with-change/threshold panels).
- Logs: live + persisted view of the Mosquitto broker log and each Miniserver's own log.
- Web UI with login, Users, Access Roles, and optional Pocket ID (OIDC) Single Sign-On.
- MQTT Users/Roles management backed by Mosquitto's dynamic-security plugin.
- Gateway database backup/restore, including scheduled backups and restore from existing storage.
- CSRF protection (synchronizer token) and login rate-limiting.
- `/healthz` endpoint and a Docker `HEALTHCHECK`.

### Changed
- Mosquitto now runs inside the same container as the gateway (previously three separate
  containers) — only one container (`loxsuite`) is visible externally.

### Known limitations
- No automated test suite yet.
- No autocomplete for Virtual Input names, no per-device MQTT topic ACLs, no device-specific
  value transforms beyond a plain translation table — see the README's "Known scope limitations".
- Miniserver/Audioserver backup (distinct from the gateway's own database backup) is not
  implemented — deliberately deferred, not an oversight.
